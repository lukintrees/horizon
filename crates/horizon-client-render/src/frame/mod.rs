//! The CPU frame contract: everything the game builds for one rendered frame,
//! before any backend sees it. Nothing in this module (or its submodules) names
//! a `wgpu` type: the renderer's GPU-owned state (pipelines, buffers, bind
//! groups, the posing store) stays in `gfx`, and the payloads the game fills in
//! are plain data the modern backend uploads and the legacy one reads through
//! the same contract (C01/R01; docs/design/legacy-gl-c01.md).
//!
//! `gfx::Frame`, `gfx::entity_skin`, `gfx::pack_draw`, `gfx::pack_uniforms`
//! and `gfx::lightning` re-export these types, so existing call sites are unchanged.
//! This is a data extraction, not yet a wgpu-free crate dependency graph: HUD
//! and other CPU producers still share modules with modern rendering code.
